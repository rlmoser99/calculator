# Calculator
This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

## Code, Re-Factor, Repeat...
I had to re-factor my work several times as I realized how different functions and variables interacted with each other. I hope to learn more on how to plan and execute a project like this more efficiently. As I am learning, I just took everything one step at time and then re-factor when necessary.

## Regex is AMAZING!
I really enjoyed working with regular expressions and probably over-used them to format the display numbers. 

## Order of Operations
The calculator is not 100% scientifically accurate. Although, I did use the order of operations published by [Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Precedence.html):
1. Parenthesis
2. Factorial
3. Exponentiation
4. Multiplication and division
5. Addition and subtraction
